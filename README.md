# BreakOutGame

A simple 2D game using a paddle, ball and a brick wall

1st Individual Project:  2D Breakout Game
Purpose of the Game – using a paddle and ball, a player must eliminate all the bricks in the wall in order to win

## Requirements

1) Create the elements of the game: a ball, a paddle and blocks within a large game grid
2) When the ball hits a block, the block disappears and the ball changes direction
3) When the ball hits the sides or top of the grid, it changes direction
4) The paddle must be moved to hit the ball and prevent the ball from falling to the bottom of the grid
5) If the paddle misses the ball, and the ball hits the bottom of the grid, “GAME OVER” appears & the game stops
6) Game keeps score by how many blocks are hit – once all the blocks are gone, “YOU WIN!” appears
